1. **Fragmented data:**
   - **Cloud-based Architecture:** Implement a cloud-based architecture that facilitates data storage and access from any location, promoting centralized data management.
   - **Data Integration:** Use MDM tools to consolidate all fragmented data from different sources into a unified, single source of truth.
   - **API Integration:** Use APIs to enable seamless data exchange between the app and other internal or external systems, ensuring data consistency.

2. **Lack of holistic customer view:**
   - **360-degree Customer View:** The app should provide a complete view of each customer's interaction with the company across all touchpoints.
   - **Data Visualization Tools:** Use data visualization tools to present customer data in an easy-to-understand format, promoting better decision-making.
   - **Predictive Analytics:** Implement predictive analytics to anticipate customer behavior, which will help tailor personalized services.

3. **A legacy approach where products drive customer data:**
   - **Customer-Centric Approach:** Transition to a customer-centric approach where customers' needs drive product and service offerings.
   - **Personalized Offerings:** Use customer data to personalize product offerings and improve customer experience.
   - **User Experience (UX) Design:** Adopt a UX design approach that focuses on the user's needs and preferences.

4. **Business units not talking to each other:**
   - **Collaboration Tools:** Incorporate collaboration tools that enable departments to communicate, collaborate, and share data effectively.
   - **Interdepartmental Workflow Design:** The app should include workflows that span across departments, encouraging inter-departmental cooperation.
   - **Real-Time Notifications:** Implement real-time notifications to alert different business units of relevant updates.

5. **No single customer view, duplicate records exist for different products:**

   - **Data Deduplication:** Employ MDM practices like data deduplication to remove any redundant customer records.
   - **Data Quality Management:** Apply data quality management practices to ensure the accuracy and consistency of customer records.

6. **Contact management is not effective; offers are not communicated to potential clients:**
   - **Automated Communication:** Implement automated communication features that send personalized offers and updates to customers.
