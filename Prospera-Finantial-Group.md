Company Name: Prospera Financial Group

Prospera Financial Group is a multinational financial institution that operates across various segments in the financial industry. The company's core operations are divided into five main departments:


**Investment Banking**: Provides financial advisory, capital markets, risk management, and other investment-related services.



**Retail Banking**: Provides everyday banking services, such as checking and savings accounts, loans, and credit card services to individual clients.

**Commercial Banking**: Serves small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), corporations, and large business entities with services like loans, credit facilities, cash management, and treasury services.


**Asset Management**: Responsible for investing and managing clients' money across a range of asset classes, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments.

**Insurance Services**: Offers various types of insurance coverage such as life, health, property, and liability insurance for individuals and businesses.

Despite being a prominent player in the financial sector, Prospera is currently facing some significant challenges due to an inefficient and fragmented data system. To overcome these hurdles, Prospera aims to transform its operation from a product-centric to a customer-centric model, employing Master Data Management (MDM) tools and practices. As part of this transition, they will develop a comprehensive digital platform that will integrate all business units, harmonize data, streamline communication, and implement effective campaign management.
